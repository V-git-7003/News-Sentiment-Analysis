# News-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to classify the news articles as positive or negative for its corresponding share value for that day. As an example, the indian division of 
vodafone company is used.
The news articles are collected from news API, and the financial details from Yahoo finance API. 
The news api only offers the data for a month. Hence, we have data for june and july as separate files. The data is first cleaned!
