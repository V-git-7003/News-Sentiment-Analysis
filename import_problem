1. ok, sys.executable in just python in terminal gives me /Users/hotte/miniconda2/envs/jupyterlab/bin/python
(after I source activate the conda env)
Within the notebook I do the same and it gives me /Users/hotte/miniconda2/bin/python .
Which is pretty puzzling? Any ideas why the notebook itself does not point to my environment that I started it from? (notebook and everything WAS installed from within the environment)

=====> sys.executable in terminal gives:
       /home/vasanth/Documents/anaconda3/envs/tf_20_env/bin/python 
=====> sys.executable in jupyter gives:
       /snap/jupyter/6/bin/python
=====> jupyter kernelspec list in terminal gives
       /snap/jupyter/6/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ipykernel/resources
=====> from jupyter_core.paths import jupyter_data_dir
       print(jupyter_data_dir())
       /home/vasanth/snap/jupyter/6/.local/share/jupyter
       

2. There'll be a kernelspec somewhere which is pointing it to a different Python. We really need to redesign that system. Run jupyter kernelspec list in a terminal to see what kernels it knows about. It will point you to directories which contain kernel.json files - one of those will be pointing it to the wrong Python.
====> There is no kernel.json in the directories mentioned after running jupyter kernelspec list
      "/snap/jupyter/6/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ipykernel/resources"
      There is no kernel.json in any nearby directories as well

3. Three paths where kernelspec could be:
====> System: 
     /usr/share/jupyter/kernels
     /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels
=====> Env:
      {sys.prefix}/share/jupyter/kernels
      
=====> User:
       ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
